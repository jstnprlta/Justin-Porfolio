            <p>Run-Buddy was our first major projects that we had been assigned to our class. assignment
                was the first stepping stone to make a web page and it was fun experience. I completed 
                the assigment and got a passing grade. This assignment was also posted on GitHub.

             <p> MetaMorph was the name i gave this assignment. adjustments had to
                 be made to this web page and edits to make it function on the GitHub.
                 completed and passed assigment.
